# hello-world
The repository used for #CodeFirstGirls' course.
This will be used to help Paige and I communicate with each other during the time we are making an amazing website that will definitely win the competition. To not be a heavy stone which holds Paige down from achieving great heights, one must practice at least a little bit of coding daily as it seems my brain cannot obtain last weeks information as clearly as one would expect. Sigh ...   화이팅~
